1. Animate in Adobe After Effects
2. Install the bodymovin add on
3. Convert animation to json file
4. Drag and drop it in lottie website to view the animation
5. Use code to animate it on scroll.
	-code includes libraries from gsap (mainly ScrollTrigger) and lottie-web
	-its a function I found online and I added somemore parameters that we can set to change the way the animation plays on scroll
