1. Animate in Adobe After Effects
2. Install the bodymovin add on
3. Convert animation to json file
4. Drag and drop it in lottie website to view the animation
5. Use code to animate it on scroll.
	-code includes libraries from gsap (mainly ScrollTrigger) and lottie-web
	-its a function I found online and I added somemore parameters that we can set to change the way the animation plays on scroll
6. (Main idea)
	- Lottie-web used to load and render JSON files onto the webpage
	-scrolltrigger is used to tie the animation(JSON files) onto the user's scroll, as well as to set up different parameters to improve the overall scrollytelling exprience
7. (in depth line by line code from start)
	-explaining what HTML div does, what classes do
	-explain the CSS for the different classes
	-line by line javascript functions that i set to use(obj)

	-line by line explanation of the actual function???
